# Creeper_AI_Updated

Fabric port on [Creeper_AI_Updated_Fabric](https://github.com/SrGnis/Creeper_AI_Updated_Fabric)

Inpired by the mod [Epic Siege Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epic-siege-mod), Creeper AI Updated gives creepers the ability to **bomb their way to you**, so hiding in your house is no longer an option.

In addition, this mod gives creepers other abilities like fire explosions, spawning powered and jump at their targert like spiders do.

The configuration of this mod allow you to change:
* Probability of creepers spawning powered.
* Follow/awareness range.
* Range where creepers can decide to breach walls.
* Creeper ability to break walls.
* Creepers ability to leap at targets like spiders do.
* Creeper explosions cause fire.
* Maximum and minimum Y level where creepers can SPAWN WITH THE ABILITY of breach walls.
